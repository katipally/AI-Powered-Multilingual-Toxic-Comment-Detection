Salman slayed in 2005 with Maine Pyaar Kyun Kiya, No Entry, and Kyon Ki: It's Fate (although it was a commercial dud but in terms of quality it is right up there with his best work.)",

They are amazingly made movies. If you want some any recs for tamil, malayalam, kannada or telugu let me know. I will try to pick the critically acclaimed lesser known movies. Edit: and there are also well made mass and masala movies. They do exist although they are rare nowadays in tamil due to commercial directors becoming shit",
