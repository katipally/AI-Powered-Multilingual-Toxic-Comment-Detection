# Person 2 Task Completion Verification

**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Purpose:** Verify Person 2 deliverables are complete and ready to push

---

## Task Assignment (From Person 1 Handoff)

**Your Task:** Annotate 20,072 unlabeled samples as toxic (1) or non-toxic (0)

**Key Requirements from Original Specification:**
1. Deploy Label Studio; configure templates (binary toxicity + multi-label subtypes)
2. Draft guidelines with concrete examples; define gold questions and acceptance thresholds
3. Run pilot; compute Cohen's κ; refine guidelines; rerun if κ < 0.70 before scaling
4. Monitor annotators; adjudicate conflicts; maintain rationale span policy (optional)
5. Export labeled data; validate against schema; deliver batch manifests and IAA reports

---

## What Has Been Completed (Infrastructure & Tools)

### 1. Label Studio Deployment - COMPLETE
- [x] Docker setup: `annotation/docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Template configuration: `annotation/label_studio_template.xml`
- [x] Binary toxicity + multi-label subtypes configured

### 2. Annotation Guidelines - COMPLETE
- [x] `annotation/ANNOTATION_GUIDELINES.md` with examples
- [x] Gold questions template: `annotation/gold_questions.json`
- [x] Acceptance thresholds defined (κ ≥ 0.70)

### 3. Pilot & IAA Tools - COMPLETE
- [x] Script 8: Pilot data preparation (~1,000 items)
- [x] Script 9: Cohen's κ calculation with per-subtype tracking
- [x] Refine/rerun logic documented

### 4. Monitoring & Adjudication - COMPLETE
- [x] Script 11: Annotator performance dashboard
- [x] Script 12: Adjudication workflow
- [x] Rationale spans (optional) in template

### 5. Export & Validation - COMPLETE
- [x] Script 10: Export to JSONL/CSV with schema validation
- [x] Batch manifest generation
- [x] IAA report generation (script 9)

### 6. Documentation - COMPLETE
- [x] `annotation/README.md` - Setup guide
- [x] `PERSON2_HANDOFF.md` - Handoff to Person 3
- [x] `PERSON2_TASKS_SUMMARY.md` - Implementation summary
- [x] `PERSON2_REQUIREMENTS_VERIFICATION.md` - Requirements mapping

### 7. Code Quality - COMPLETE
- [x] All scripts tested and working
- [x] All emojis removed (clean for GitHub)
- [x] No errors or warnings

## Current Data Status

```
Unlabeled samples: 20,072
Code-mixed (priority): 1,869
Already labeled: 0
```

**Status:** Data ready for annotation, but **not yet annotated**

---

## What Still Needs Manual Work

These are **intended manual steps** that you or your annotation team will do:

1. [ ] Start Label Studio: `cd annotation && docker-compose up -d`
2. [ ] Manually annotate gold questions (50 items) - expert annotation
3. [ ] Import pilot data into Label Studio
4. [ ] Run pilot annotation (1,000 items with 2+ annotators)
5. [ ] Calculate IAA using script 9
6. [ ] If κ < 0.70: Refine guidelines, rerun pilot
7. [ ] Scale to full dataset (20,072 items) after κ ≥ 0.70
8. [ ] Export final annotations using script 10
9. [ ] Validate and hand off to Person 3

## Can You Push This Code?

### YES - You can push with this message:

**Option 1 (Infrastructure/Tools Delivery):**
```
Person 2: Annotation infrastructure and quality control system

- Deploy Label Studio with Docker setup
- Create annotation guidelines and interface template
- Implement pilot data preparation script
- Add IAA calculation (Cohen's kappa, per-subtype)
- Create annotation export pipeline (JSONL/CSV with validation)
- Build annotator performance dashboard
- Add adjudication workflow
- Update requirements.txt
- All scripts tested and working
- Complete documentation included

Status: Infrastructure complete. Ready for annotation workflow.
Next: Manual annotation of 20,072 samples using provided tools.
```

**Option 2 (If you've completed some annotation):**
```
Person 2: Annotation system and [X] samples annotated

[Include what you've actually completed]
```

---

## Important Notes

1. **Your Deliverables:** You've completed the **infrastructure and tools** part of Person 2
2. **Manual Annotation:** The actual annotation of 20,072 samples is a separate manual task
3. **Pilot First:** You should run pilot annotation before scaling (workflow documented)
4. **Documentation:** All tools and workflows are fully documented

## Recommendation

**YES, push your code now** with Option 1 commit message.

The infrastructure is complete, tested, and ready. The manual annotation work (annotating 20,072 samples) can be done as a follow-up or by the annotation team using the tools you've created.

Your task as Person 2 includes both:
1. ✅ **Infrastructure setup** (COMPLETE - ready to push)
2. ⏳ **Annotation execution** (To be done using the infrastructure)

---

**Status:** ✅ READY TO PUSH
