reddit_ndytgci,"Sorry it may feel long, please be with me. Recently a few incidents really shook me: 1. Two thieves broke into a house around 2 AM when only a mother and daughter were home. The father and elder sister were on a night shift. The thieves entered by breaking a window. The mother and daughter locked themselves in a room and called the police and their family. The family came back from Gurugram to Noida the same night, but the police came only at 8 AM. Until then, the thieves destroyed the house. To stay safe, the mother and daughter stayed silent and locked in. Impact: I am scared to leave my family alone when I have to travel for office work. 2. A couple called a local electrician to repair their geyser. The husband went to the office, and the electrician started masturbating inside the washroom with the door open. When the wife confronted him, he tried to molest her. Impact: I now take leave even when a cylinder delivery guy comes, just to make sure someone is home. 3. Even celebrities are not safe. Saif Ali Khan was attacked inside his own house. If someone with security and status can be attacked, what about normal people like us? Impact: I feel scared about safety even inside gated societies. Other things bother me too, school teachers trying to touch students badly, police taking bribes to hide cases or remove FIRs, bullying, increasing road rage, fake identities used to manipulate people into love and kidnapping, small arguments turning into killings, politicians filled with corruption. Then there are disturbing comments online, people openly talking about rape and murder like it‚Äôs nothing. This mentality exists around us. Even health insurance feels unreliable, in serious cases, companies try to avoid paying. It feels like whichever way you go, there‚Äôs always a trap. All this makes me feel hopeless. Sometimes I think I should even bring a child into this world? Do I really want my future kids to face the same? Honestly, I feel like ending my family tree here. Seeing news and hearing such stories gives me chills. It feels like society is collapsing, not just in my country but across the world. Has anyone else felt the same?

reddit_nm7l0k0,"A chilling honour killing case in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, was solved thanks to a random nuisance call complaint. The 25-year-old victim, who had married outside her caste against her family's wishes, was raped and murdered by her father, 55-year-old Kamal, in November 2021. The crime occurred in the Samasgarh forest, where Kamal lured his daughter and her eight-month-old infant, who had died of pneumonia, under the pretense of burying the child. Once in the forest, Kamal accused her of dishonoring the family, sexually assaulted her, and strangled her to death. The bodies were discovered on November 14, 2021, in a decomposed state with signs of sexual assault and strangulation. The investigation initially lacked leads until a nuisance call complaint provided a crucial breakthrough. The victim had used her neighbour Radheyshyam‚Äôs phone to call her husband while staying at her sister‚Äôs home. When she went missing, her husband repeatedly called Radheyshyam‚Äôs number, prompting Radheyshyam to file a complaint. Police linked these calls to the unidentified bodies, and Radheyshyam‚Äôs recollection of the victim using his phone helped confirm the identities. **The victim‚Äôs sister later revealed the truth to police, leading to the arrest of Kamal and his son.** Interrogations confirmed the full details of the crime, with Kamal admitting he had planned the murder for months. **Both father and son were charged with murder, rape, and criminal conspiracy.**",,reddit,en,unlabeled,False,"{""original_id"": ""nm7l0k0"", ""subreddit"": ""india"", ""score"": 18, ""created_utc"": ""2025-10-30T08:47:49"", ""comment_depth"": 0}"

reddit_nma5f9e,"As a junior doctor hoping to major in obgyn, here's my opinion: What is looking standard from your story - 1. The ureter being injured during a TAH+BSO: they usually mention this in the consent form too where I have worked, at least. It's a very common complication of the procedure because yes, the ureter is super close to the uterus all through its middle and lower third part. It'll get in the way, whether you want it or not. Some ureteric injuries are picked up within the OT itself when it's visible in cases of mechanical kinking or a suture has caught it. However, a lot of them get picked in the post operative period because it'll look anatomically okay during surgery but if its blood supply was destroyed (thermal injury/manipulation), it takes time to manifest. 2. Delay in reports: As unfortunate and irritating this is, it has become so normalised that from a legal stand point, I don't think it will hold any value. The GLARINGLY obvious red flags: 1. It took 12 days to get the diagnosis?????? When this is like a textbook, most common surgical complication of the procedure? Everyone and their mothers know how common this is - therefore, it is to be expected - therefore, even a minimum red flag is grounds to get imaging. The fact that you went to an ER and they didn't pick this up (provided that you gave them the full history) and THEN you went to the operating doctor 9 days later and she didn't pick it up either? Wtf what did she think it was going to be 9 days post op with a clear surgical site? 2. The conflicting explanations: that looks shady as hell and points a finger at the credibility of the doctors but practically, whether it was anatomical/thermal - complication would have been the same and required the same corrective surgery. Also, it is quite difficult to pick up an anatomic aberration on scans. Usually if you're doing the procedure open, you can increase your chances of picking it up but laparoscopic really skews with the depth of imaging. So don't think that's particularly wrong. 3. The money for the corrective surgery is huge. I personally am not super knowledgeable here but ethically, feels super wrong. Here's my advice: 1. Get a copy of all documents - consent forms, intra op notes, post op notes, imaging, lab values, progress sheets, discharge summary - everything. Tell them that you're planning to move to another state so having these documents will help the new doctor there establish her care better. Also keep a copy of your request asking these documents. Also ask for an itemised bill (basically a bill that tells you what exactly you were billed for in full detail). 2. Consult another doctor not linked to this hospital. A good, reputed doctor. Ask them if they feel there was a lapse in her care. Usually, good medical colleges have great faculty. 3. Don't create a ruckus in the hospital now. Wait for discharge. Collect all documents, though. Especially the ones from her first surgery till the day she goy diagnosed - the ER notes too. 4. Lawyer up, I guess? I'm not super resourceful here. Bottom line: doesn't matter if you win the case or not, your mom went through shit and this shouldn't happen again, to anyone.

reddit_nm9r8oz,"On 30th October 2025, Rohit Aarrya kidnapped 20 kids in a studio in Powai, Mumbai. He released a video stating he wanted to ask some questions to a few people. If you watch the entire clip, all signs point towards him being a psychopath, except for one line, stating ""Mujhe kuch logon se baat karni hai unko saval puchne hai, unke jawab par agar mujhe counter question hai to mujhe counter question puchna hai"" Intrigued by this, I hopped onto social media to find out what his question were. Digging deeper into forums and articles it seemed like there were some disputes and allegations about a promised compensation. Now, this guy kidnapped kids. And you never bring kids between any disputes! So, according to me, this guy got what he deserved. Shooting is legitimate if innocent kids are involved. But lets just dissociate from this guy for a second. Imagine if there was some other guy. Remember the first sentence of the released video? ""Hello, Me Rohit Aarrya. Suic\*\*de karne ki jagha -"". Now, instead of taking such vile action of kidnapping children, imagine our other guy did commit suic\*\*de. He felt the rope pulling up his neck, cracking on his bone as he just hoped that the tape which he recorded of himself and released on the internet - will finally get traction and he will, hopefully, get justice. Hopefully. Justice from what? Of course, he hoped that people will take into consideration his work of past 7 years, all his youtube channel filled with videos of children demonstrating his initiative, More than a single year of fasting and demanding the government for his rights. Thankfully for him, people do recognize and empathize with him. But at the cost of his life. So who is responsible for this? Back to Rohit Aarrya, what circumstances led to this anarchic nature? The Rohit Aarrya of yesterday got what he deserved, there no question about it. But what about the Rohit Aarrya from one month ago? The one from 1 year ago? Isn't this an argument of determinism that, because he did not get the proper enquiry which he wished for 1 year ago, led to his actions of yesterday? Some neurological conditioning in the brain from months of hate against some VVIPs, which exploded into such chaos? This guy did love children before. 4,5,6,7 years ago. Every article I have linked below in pastebin displays that. His hashtag swachhatamonitor is filled with kids videos following his ""Let's Change"" initiative and appreciating it. We cannot point out the exact moment when that changed, what triggered in his mind to take such a drastic act, but what we can say is, in a cerebis paribus world, the government could have saved him. Saved the horrifying act that occurred yesterday in Mumbai.

Their main goal is to show the world how successful and trendy they are. They tend to YOLO life and don't tend to focus on future planning. Then there are people who buy things to get functional benefit out of them. They will buy the devices that get the job done, and if two devices get the job done, they will buy the cheaper one. They generally don't care about what people think of them, and they focus on getting value out of their life and from their gadgets. They also tend to have financial discipline and focus on delayed gratification - which is the one trait that separates the successful from unsuccessful. Think of the kids who foregoed partying and enjoying in their 11th and 12th and college and instead, studied hard to do well in entrance exams or to build real coding skills. They delayed their gratification and sacrificed or compromised their immediate enjoyment to get much better returns for a better future.

reddit_nma5f9e_683,"As a junior doctor hoping to major in obgyn, here's my opinion: What is looking standard from your story - 1. The ureter being injured during a TAH+BSO: they usually mention this in the consent form too where I have worked, at least. It's a very common complication of the procedure because yes, the ureter is super close to the uterus all through its middle and lower third part. It'll get in the way, whether you want it or not. Some ureteric injuries are picked up within the OT itself when it's visible in cases of mechanical kinking or a suture has caught it. However, a lot of them get picked in the post operative period because it'll look anatomically okay during surgery but if its blood supply was destroyed (thermal injury/manipulation), it takes time to manifest. 2. Delay in reports: As unfortunate and irritating this is, it has become so normalised that from a legal stand point, I don't think it will hold any value. The GLARINGLY obvious red flags: 1. It took 12 days to get the diagnosis?????? When this is like a textbook, most common surgical complication of the procedure? Everyone and their mothers know how common this is - therefore, it is to be expected - therefore, even a minimum red flag is grounds to get imaging. The fact that you went to an ER and they didn't pick this up (provided that you gave them the full history) and THEN you went to the operating doctor 9 days later and she didn't pick it up either? Wtf what did she think it was going to be 9 days post op with a clear surgical site? 2. The conflicting explanations: that looks shady as hell and points a finger at the credibility of the doctors but practically, whether it was anatomical/thermal - complication would have been the same and required the same corrective surgery. Also, it is quite difficult to pick up an anatomic aberration on scans. Usually if you're doing the procedure open, you can increase your chances of picking it up but laparoscopic really skews with the depth of imaging. So don't think that's particularly wrong. 3. The money for the corrective surgery is huge. I personally am not super knowledgeable here but ethically, feels super wrong. Here's my advice: 1. Get a copy of all documents - consent forms, intra op notes, post op notes, imaging, lab values, progress sheets, discharge summary - everything. Tell them that you're planning to move to another state so having these documents will help the new doctor there establish her care better. Also keep a copy of your request asking these documents. Also ask for an itemised bill (basically a bill that tells you what exactly you were billed for in full detail). 2. Consult another doctor not linked to this hospital. A good, reputed doctor. Ask them if they feel there was a lapse in her care. Usually, good medical colleges have great faculty. 3. Don't create a ruckus in the hospital now. Wait for discharge. Collect all documents, though. Especially the ones from her first surgery till the day she goy diagnosed - the ER notes too. 4. Lawyer up, I guess? I'm not super resourceful here.

reddit_nluygz7,"So, I read about this as to why certain countries are more developed than India despite starting out similar or worse. I would like to make this clear first off that this is in no way a justification of failures of our administrative machinery or the social attitudes that people possess. Those are the things that we need to call out and work on. Now the examples that are cited are: China which as you mentioned is authoritarian and not a democracy \[but they can be credited for their economic reforms and this is where criticism for our economic reforms also come in because they happened too late and they have certain issues. South Korea and Japan are homogeneous, smaller geography and smaller population and had USA support. Reason being, they are capitalist hellholes and their social progress isn't equal to their economic progress. Now, should India have strayed away from non alignment is something that is complex and you can make your comparison. Singapore is interesting. Even though they have a smaller population and geography, some of their policies really impressed me. A learning that India can take from them is how distribution of administrative power into scales \[panchayats, municipalities\] is important and how we should work on improving that. Cleanliness and civic sense is something I agree on. It is something that needs to be addressed because this not only costs us our image but also money. Many people cite \*\*casteism\*\*. But if that were the case, majority of India belongs to lower caste groups. So, majority of it should not have that problem. But it does. Though, this needs to be critiqued and it is high time that this is pushed as a major issue. What our learning should be is that we need to find solutions that work for us the same way Singapore/other countries did.

They‚Äôre actually quite well-off, with good land and wealth. Interestingly, they weren‚Äôt originally classified as SC, but a few decades ago they were added to the category for reservation benefits. Recently, some volunteers from the community wanted to opt out of the SC category. They were quite vocal about identifying as part of the general category, saying their ancestors were added to the SC list only for quota benefits. They even started collecting signatures from community members to give up the quota and file a plea to be moved back to the general category ‚Äî and guess what? Less than 2‚Äì3% of people signed it.",,reddit,en,unlabeled,False,"{""original_id"": ""nlburaa"", ""subreddit"": ""india"", ""score"": 1, ""created_utc"": ""2025-10-25T09:03:50"", ""comment_depth"": 0}"

reddit_nldbk64,"It exists and is very nuanced, this tribalistic superiority complex existing in 2025 shame on our society. Now for nuanced, and I am not saying my experience is the only valid or even majority one, so many demographic factors influence it subtly due to its systemic and engrained nature which let's some of the worst practitioners of it not even be self aware of the crass thing they are practicing. This IMHO and as per my personal experience, I have found to be the worst, in my area, in some ""castes"" traditionally and still in some other areas classified under ""lower castes"", this has been my observation. By far the most subconscious as well as sometimes conscious glorification of caste ""pride"" in slogans as being superior to so called ""bhaiyyas (migrant workers), owning most land and having influence the most as well, misplaced superiority complex in these riches and also in belonging to 'Martial Race' (much like Pakistani Punjabis, Gurkhas, Kumaons etc etc getting limelight in both societies as belonging to and recruited by British for being 'Martial Races') posters and stickers, songs, media, votebank, so called ""social prestige"" etc I have found to be in .. Jat Sikhs. Ironically they were labelled as lower caste by Brits, and are still OBC in nearby states, same as Rajputs considered ruling clan in R-sthan are classed under OBC in my state. Also compared to the age of caste origins, it is pretty modern outlook quite changed by the green revolution that made Jatt Sikhs the biggest landlords. Traditionally the ""prestige"" castes of the area were other varied ones also having similar hold as them back when there were Princley states of Punjab. Similarly the current Guru of Sikhs is Gur Granth Sahib and the 10 who held Gurgaddi, every one of them was Hindu Khatri. I am sorry if pointing one community out in particular out of the multitudes ultimately guilty of it might be considered biased by some, but this has simply been my objective observation of my extended circle, society, what I have consumed in the media here etc. The second most openly guilty of it I have found to be , Balmikis what would be considered Shudra in other places as I understand, one of the supposedly ""lowest castes"", again I have observed it in my personal circle, the political landscape, ""strongarm"" orgs (same as some other castes also have in other areas where they have a majority population), also this is a major differentiator, a strong sense of unity in having endured the abuses of caste system and having developed into a popular societal image of being immoral, combative, street smart and ready for violence , as well as pride in Ambedkar (among others) having faced worse difficulties and achieved heights of eminence. This strong counter-shiting of the narrative is a fairly recent phenomena sp compared to origin of caste system, and for whatever reason, I have not personally witnessed much in other Scheduled Castes, in fact there are gotra/varna and their sub and super-subdiv etc divisions hierarchy and the relatively higher compared to the lowest that schedule caste has, the lesser the pride in caste and more orthodox system they don't to observe from what I have witnessed. Sorry for the long post, its 2 am and didn't sleep for a couple days so am typing very slowly.Also, as stated eatlier, of course others' experiences would be different and also valid of course. Most importantly within context of this post of mine, I am well aware such elitist caste roles are played by different communities in different areas with certain general thumb rules like socio-political dominance, superiority complex, better std of living etc Also before pressing submit I want to postulate that regardless of caste, the most visceral communal hatred I have seen in my area (specially since the outflux of NRI's from Punjab, and farming being done by contract by migrant labourers rather than the traditional landlords themselves which was Jutts who are now landowners only ) is directed not at any caste but very openly flaunted at the 'Purbias' or 'Bhaiyyas'.

reddit_nlzw7gj,"Here's TL:DR in video form. https://nitter.net/TheEconomist/status/1931274938893148213 > The Indo-Gangetic plain is among the world‚Äôs most polluted areas. Heavy industry, traffic emissions, agricultural-waste burning and the use of solid fuels for cooking all contribute to high aerosol levels. Several studies have suggested that higher levels of these pollutants over the past two decades may have somewhat counteracted the effect of rising temperatures in the region. But the fact that sooty particles absorb sunlight rather than reflect it, cooling the surface but warming the atmosphere, complicates matters. One recent study found that in the spring of 2020, when lockdowns caused a drastic reduction in pollutants in many Indian cities, temperatures did not spike as some scientists expected but rather were unusually cool. The paper only examined temperatures over a few months, and so changes could be due to chance fluctuations, but ‚Äúit‚Äôs still a little puzzling,‚Äù says Loretta Mickley, a climate scientist at Harvard University.

NCRB counts a case as ‚Äúfalse‚Äù even when the victim withdraws due to family pressure, fear, harassment, or the emotional cost of trial so your ‚Äúfake case = she lied‚Äù logic isn‚Äôt just wrong, it‚Äôs dishonest. Convenient assumptions to hide from the Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) 2014 report that revealed that 53.2% of the rape cases filed between April 2013 and July 2014 were false. >And in India, the vast majority of rapes are by someone known to the victim which is exactly why they‚Äôre hard to prove and why survivors hesitate to report. Again, very convenient assumption and why specifically India? It‚Äôs magically easier to prove in other countries? >Meanwhile, most sexual assaults never even get reported, because everyone knows the victim will be the one put on trial socially as is happening in this thread. A low conviction rate doesn‚Äôt mean accusations are fake it means the system fails survivors through weak investigations, witness intimidation, police apathy, and societal shaming. Sarvjeet case, Boys locker room fake chats, 17 year old Manav Singh case. These are just a few examples I could think on top of my head and in all of them innocent guys were put on trial socially because of mere accusations. Even cases like Atul Subhash case show it‚Äôs not as simple and convenient as you are making it out to be. System and society often gives benefit of the doubt to woman. Media often shows the face of r@pe accused men even before conviction, men also loose their jobs due to it.

But let's be real, this kind of kindness only works when such cases are 1 out of 1000. In practice, I fault all the Bihari's who still LIVE in Bihar OR call it ""home"" and keep going back every year and keep voter-id and PAN number in Bihar. I am grateful to my ancestors, who ALSO faced hardship countless times throughout the last MILLENIA and had to pickup the pieces and MOVE to a new unknown place with only the gods on their head (sometimes without that). A few generations later they prospered. The lands around Bihar are cursed. Anyone still staying there is to blame.

But we have to make rule /law that no one can make fun of religion beliefs because in even hindu now a days people are raising their voice and it is good to raise voice but not go to the extreme end but some people go there also in other case you know what will happen to you if you have done something....so instead of giving power to mob just put the rule / law that way this problem is solved.,,reddit,en,unlabeled,False,"{""original_id"": ""nlrhaw3"", ""subreddit"": ""IndiaSpeaks"", ""score"": 2, ""created_utc"": ""2025-10-27T19:47:49"", ""comment_depth"": 0}"

Convenient assumptions to hide from the Delhi Commission of Women (DCW) 2014 report that revealed that 53.2% of the rape cases filed between April 2013 and July 2014 were false. >And in India, the vast majority of rapes are by someone known to the victim which is exactly why they‚Äôre hard to prove and why survivors hesitate to report.

It‚Äôs magically easier to prove in other countries? >Meanwhile, most sexual assaults never even get reported, because everyone knows the victim will be the one put on trial socially as is happening in this thread. A low conviction rate doesn‚Äôt mean accusations are fake it means the system fails survivors through weak investigations, witness intimidation, police apathy, and societal shaming. Sarvjeet case, Boys locker room fake chats, 17 year old Manav Singh case.

reddit_nlyt77e,"Apna opinion toh do OP ji. These are mine: 1) Remove all laws regarding religion, no majority-minority BS. Stop giving any kind of government aid, support, etc. and dissolve all government bodies regarding religion. Make religion-based quotas in any job, college, school illegal. Start taxing religious trusts like normal businesses. Religion is a private matter and it should remain as such. This is how we can become truly secular. 2) There should be an entrance exam like UPSC for politicians. Only those who clear it should be allowed to contest elections. Make civics education a barrier for entry into politics. 3) Also, politicians should be fined double of regular citizens for everything, from littering to tax evasion. They are the elected representatives of their citizens, they should be made to lead by example. Edit: To everyone commenting, it's not possible, thanks for pointing out the painfully obvious! I know that this is possible only in a utopian society whereas we live in a Orwellian-Huxleyan-Phildickian hybrid dystopia of our own making, where those in power get more and more powerful by fooling those who are less powerful into thinking that they are taking power away from people different than them, by supporting these powerful people. Basically, we live in a Topi-topia, jaha pe jo jitna bada hai, woh utna jyada topi laga raha hai. So, I don't expect these opinions to ever be taken seriously, or discussed in terms of how it would be implemented. These are just opinions, and it should remain as such.

reddit_nlyt77e_4049,"Apna opinion toh do OP ji. These are mine: 1) Remove all laws regarding religion, no majority-minority BS. Stop giving any kind of government aid, support, etc. and dissolve all government bodies regarding religion. Make religion-based quotas in any job, college, school illegal. Start taxing religious trusts like normal businesses. Religion is a private matter and it should remain as such. This is how we can become truly secular. 2) There should be an entrance exam like UPSC for politicians. Only those who clear it should be allowed to contest elections. Make civics education a barrier for entry into politics. 3) Also, politicians should be fined double of regular citizens for everything, from littering to tax evasion. They are the elected representatives of their citizens, they should be made to lead by example. Edit: To everyone commenting, it's not possible, thanks for pointing out the painfully obvious! I know that this is possible only in a utopian society whereas we live in a Orwellian-Huxleyan-Phildickian hybrid dystopia of our own making, where those in power get more and more powerful by fooling those who are less powerful into thinking that they are taking power away from people different than them, by supporting these powerful people. Basically, we live in a Topi-topia, jaha pe jo jitna bada hai, woh utna jyada topi laga raha hai.

reddit_nlyt77e_4461,"Apna opinion toh do OP ji. These are mine: 1) Remove all laws regarding religion, no majority-minority BS. Stop giving any kind of government aid, support, etc. and dissolve all government bodies regarding religion. Make religion-based quotas in any job, college, school illegal. Start taxing religious trusts like normal businesses. Religion is a private matter and it should remain as such. This is how we can become truly secular. 2) There should be an entrance exam like UPSC for politicians. Only those who clear it should be allowed to contest elections. Make civics education a barrier for entry into politics. 3) Also, politicians should be fined double of regular citizens for everything, from littering to tax evasion. They are the elected representatives of their citizens, they should be made to lead by example. Edit: To everyone commenting, it's not possible, thanks for pointing out the painfully obvious! I know that this is possible only in a utopian society whereas we live in a Orwellian-Huxleyan-Phildickian hybrid dystopia of our own making, where those in power get more and more powerful by fooling those who are less powerful into thinking that they are taking power away from people different than them, by supporting these powerful people. Basically, we live in a Topi-topia, jaha pe jo jitna bada hai, woh utna jyada topi laga raha hai. So, I don't expect these opinions to ever be taken seriously, or discussed in terms of how it would be implemented. These are just opinions, and it should remain as such.

reddit_nm55l9x,"Sorry OP but it's not just about ""simple problems"" or some specific scenes that you find cringey. It's not about one movie, it's more about what bollywood has turned into. And the reasons behind it. There are many systemic problems in Bollywood. Whole of our movie industry now reeks of self-imposed mediocrity. The industry is driven by greedy ultra-capitalistic non-creative studio bosses that look for quick money without taking any risk. As a result of this risk-averse and RoI first financing mindset, ceative writing and engaging story-telling take a back seat. Instead the production houses resort to tried & tested genres and ""star power"". And of late, this star power is being defined by number of followers on Instagram which is f*ckin ridiculous. Majority of the budget is eaten up by these so called ""stars"" and marketing, leaving very little money for script-writers. Bollywood also suffers from an extremely weak writers ecosystem. Ideally writers should have been treated as the most important part of a movie but in bollywood they are given no priority and are severely underpaid. Anyone from the hero, heroine or the studio boss can anytime change the story to suit their agenda. This kills the motivation in writers do come up with a good script. Creative experimentation is already dead in bollywood. Crores are spent on marketing of an average movie like Saiyara and many others. Why not spend this money on writers and people who are actually responsible for churning out a decent movie? Audience like us are manipulated by fake box office numbers that are one of the biggest scams of bollywood. I don't know what's this lust over earning numbers 100 cr, 500 cr? I mean who gives a f*ck? Give us a good movie - don't throw these fake ass numbers on us. When movies are bad, who needs good actors? Star kids with high count of insta followers are enough. Massive PR machineries are deployed to make the likes of Jahnvi Kapoor, Aryan Khan, Ananya Pandey gain extreme popularity. Reputed media like ToI, HT, etc are paid heavily to publish the ""news"" of these celebrities specially when their movies are about to release. Nepotism flourishes only because of mediocrity. The day bollywood start producing decent movies, only the real talent will be able to survive. On top of these we are now seeing right wing propaganda based movies banking on hinduism and nationalism. There was an era from 1970s to 2017-18 when the movies had the courage to question and expose the system. Remember Rang De Basanti, PK, Shahid, few of the last good movies of bollywood? Now no one dares to experiment, dissent, question and expose. Bollywood is not an industry anymore. It has become a factory where the assembly line keeps churning out the same recycled shit over and over. It has become the cemetery of art and cradle of mediocrity, greed, jingoism and nepotism.

reddit_nm7p47l,"Isnt the answer simple.....you cant label any culture, country, community in one shade and say that all members of that group are either all good or all bad. Hence movies or literature that paint every one in one shade are perhaps an extreme view towards that community. So when movies like Sardhar Udham, Lagaan, Mangal Pandey etc show that among the community of the movie's antagonist there are a few or even one good person that is a more realistic and better depiction of those communities. Secondly comparing these movies with war movies is not accurate because they are very different genres. If you compare American WWII movies with Hindi movies then you have to look at movies like Border, LOC, Lakshya etc where you will not see different shades in the opposing military. The right comparison for Pre-Independence movies from India will be pre-independence movies from US like the Patriot, Last of the Mohicans or movies like Rob Roy or Braveheard from a Scotland perspective.

reddit_nm7uvvu,"I actually realized that remakes were an essential part of movie making across the globe when I watched the multiple Oscar award winning Ben-Hur in the 70s as a kid and was a shock to realize that it was a remake of a 1925 silent movie when its B&W chariot race scenes were shown in a DD program. Sholay is one of my favorite movies of all time and when i watched it in theater in the 70s, I recognized a few scenes from Once upon a time in the west which I had seen with my parents at a Film Festival. All film industries have a healthy share of remakes every year which ranges from 10-20%. Most of the world looks at remakes as a medium to tell stories to a new generation or expose audiences to stories from other culture, countries and eras. Unfortunately in India we have started to pre-judge and ridicule remakes irrespective of their quality even if we have not watched the original.....which is a shame. The reality is that good original movies will eventually get remade. All industries go through a phase of original creativity which are termed as their golden eras which come once in a few decades. Rajnikanth became a superstar after the success of Billa which was a remake of Big B's Don. Deewar was remade in Hong Kong by the Shaw Brothers as the Brother, a movie that inspired John Woo to make A Better tomorrow which pioneered HK's action genre that impacted Hollywood a few decades later. Aashiqui was a remake of A Star is Born which has been remade 4 times and all 4 versions which big hits and Oscar winners of their respective eras. Not all movies made in any industry are remakes and every industry has remakes. Good remakes should be appreciated and bad ones panned.",,reddit,en,unlabeled,False,"{""original_id"": ""nm7uvvu"", ""subreddit"": ""bollywood"", ""score"": 4, ""created_utc"": ""2025-10-30T09:34:37"", ""comment_depth"": 0}"

reddit_nm7p47l_5182,"Isnt the answer simple.....you cant label any culture, country, community in one shade and say that all members of that group are either all good or all bad.

So when movies like Sardhar Udham, Lagaan, Mangal Pandey etc show that among the community of the movie's antagonist there are a few or even one good person that is a more realistic and better depiction of those communities. Secondly comparing these movies with war movies is not accurate because they are very different genres. If you compare American WWII movies with Hindi movies then you have to look at movies like Border, LOC, Lakshya etc where you will not see different shades in the opposing military. The right comparison for Pre-Independence movies from India will be pre-independence movies from US like the Patriot, Last of the Mohicans or movies like Rob Roy or Braveheard from a Scotland perspective.

reddit_nm55l9x_5340,"Sorry OP but it's not just about ""simple problems"" or some specific scenes that you find cringey. It's not about one movie, it's more about what bollywood has turned into. And the reasons behind it. There are many systemic problems in Bollywood. Whole of our movie industry now reeks of self-imposed mediocrity. The industry is driven by greedy ultra-capitalistic non-creative studio bosses that look for quick money without taking any risk. As a result of this risk-averse and RoI first financing mindset, ceative writing and engaging story-telling take a back seat. Instead the production houses resort to tried & tested genres and ""star power"". And of late, this star power is being defined by number of followers on Instagram which is f*ckin ridiculous. Majority of the budget is eaten up by these so called ""stars"" and marketing, leaving very little money for script-writers. Bollywood also suffers from an extremely weak writers ecosystem. Ideally writers should have been treated as the most important part of a movie but in bollywood they are given no priority and are severely underpaid. Anyone from the hero, heroine or the studio boss can anytime change the story to suit their agenda. This kills the motivation in writers do come up with a good script. Creative experimentation is already dead in bollywood. Crores are spent on marketing of an average movie like Saiyara and many others. Why not spend this money on writers and people who are actually responsible for churning out a decent movie? Audience like us are manipulated by fake box office numbers that are one of the biggest scams of bollywood. I don't know what's this lust over earning numbers 100 cr, 500 cr? I mean who gives a f*ck? Give us a good movie - don't throw these fake ass numbers on us. When movies are bad, who needs good actors? Star kids with high count of insta followers are enough. Massive PR machineries are deployed to make the likes of Jahnvi Kapoor, Aryan Khan, Ananya Pandey gain extreme popularity. Reputed media like ToI, HT, etc are paid heavily to publish the ""news"" of these celebrities specially when their movies are about to release. Nepotism flourishes only because of mediocrity. The day bollywood start producing decent movies, only the real talent will be able to survive. On top of these we are now seeing right wing propaganda based movies banking on hinduism and nationalism. There was an era from 1970s to 2017-18 when the movies had the courage to question and expose the system. Remember Rang De Basanti, PK, Shahid, few of the last good movies of bollywood? Now no one dares to experiment, dissent, question and expose. Bollywood is not an industry anymore. It has become a factory where the assembly line keeps churning out the same recycled shit over and over. It has become the cemetery of art and cradle of mediocrity, greed, jingoism and nepotism. TLDR: Bollywood movies are shit. Avoid it like you avoid a shit.",,reddit,en,unlabeled,False,"{""original_id"": ""nm55l9x"", ""subreddit"": ""bollywood"", ""score"": 3, ""created_utc"": ""2025-10-29T22:15:31"", ""comment_depth"": 0}"

reddit_nlejfly,"Her roles in films like *Khwahish* (2003) and *Murder* (2004), particularly the latter's iconic steamy kiss with Emraan Hashmi and her portrayal of a femme fatale, made her a sensation and a symbol of a new kind of heroine‚Äîdaring, unapologetic, and self-assured. However, this boldness led to significant backlash, with many in the industry, including some prominent female actors, being condescending and shaming her for her choices, often using derogatory language like ""So many sluts in Bollywood, one more"". She recalled feeling so distressed by this treatment that she went crying to her mentor, Mahesh Bhatt. The media and public often reduced her to the label of a ""sex symbol"" or ""bold"" actress, overlooking her talent and the depth of her performances. This perception was reinforced by the intense scrutiny of her personal life, with many men misinterpreting her on-screen boldness as an invitation for inappropriate advances, despite her clear distinction between professional and personal life. Some women in the industry were reportedly vicious towards her, possibly because her glamour and confidence were seen as threatening to traditional norms. Despite the negative reactions, her work resonated with many women who connected with the story of loneliness and independence portrayed in *Murder*, which contributed to its enduring legacy as a cult classic. Sherawat herself has stated that the cultural environment was not ready for her or her roles at the time, and she believes Bollywood has only now caught up to the space she occupied in 2004. Mallika Sherawat has not been actively involved in mainstream Bollywood films in recent years, a shift she attributes to her refusal to compromise on her principles, which reportedly led to her being replaced by other actresses on numerous projects. She has stated that male actors and producers avoided working with her because she would not conform to demands, including those related to off-screen intimacy or personal boundaries, which she believes reflects a broader societal issue. Despite this, she continues to work in the industry, with her most recent film being RK/RKay. * Mallika Sherawat revealed that she lost 20-30 film projects because male actors refused to work with her, preferring actresses who would comply with their demands, including personal favors. * She has cited her strong personality and unwillingness to compromise as reasons for being excluded from roles, stating that A-list heroes refused to work with her because she would not submit to their whims. * The actress has also spoken about being thrown out of projects for refusing to engage in off-screen intimacy with co-stars, a situation she describes as reflective of the challenges women face in the industry. * As of October 2025, Mallika Sherawat is based in Los Angeles and has expressed that the social environment in India feels regressive for women compared to the freedom she experiences in the United States. * While her mainstream film career in India has diminished, she remains active in the industry and has continued to take on roles, including her recent appearance in RK/RKay.",,reddit,en,unlabeled,False,"{""original_id"": ""nlejfly"", ""subreddit"": ""bollywood"", ""score"": 7, ""created_utc"": ""2025-10-25T17:56:09"", ""comment_depth"": 0}"

reddit_nm8byh8,"- Doesn't surprise me at the least about Harsh tbh. Anil generally wears his mood on his sleeve anyway, and it is so so clear that he feels disappointed and hurt with his son. Also, say what you will about their personalities, but Anil's daughters are a tight unit and really show up for family stuff, but Harsh seems to be a different case altogether. Even during Animal promos, I remember Anil saying that he drew a little bit from his own relationship with his son in terms of unsaid grudges, resentments, etc. - Y'all might kill me for saying this LOL, but Harsh is not a bad actor at all. I haven't seen Mirzya but based on Ray, Thar, and Bhavesh Joshi, he has alot of potential and he knows what he is doing. But his off-screen personality is so off-putting and he has very little screen-presence so I think the best he can do (if he gets his act together) is have a solid acting career with critical acclaim. Not star material at all. - Excited about Aryan's future after Bads. He seems hyper self-aware. He is Gen-Z, he is hella privileged, and he does not wear the shadow of legacy from his dad even though he loves to pay it tribute. He knows who he is and plays to his strengths - which is how everyone should operate in life anyway - play the cards you are dealt! Looking forward to whatever he does next. - Rohit Shetty and Kumal Khemu are actually a surprisingly great combo for a comedy that I never thought of before.

reddit_nm56m57,Ranveer is really talented and versatile people forget and in comparison which is wrong as every actor is unique Ranbir wins even though he played the same kind of roles except Animal but due to emotional appeal and songs and great acting he is considered the best though we all will agree there is not a single movie where I felt it's Ranveer because he was always the character and with every movie of Ranbir it's always him. In India stardom is about the actor unfortunately and not character. I don't believe Ranbir has no PR. The whole industry is his PR. After Animal I was shocked to see how Shahid was treated versus Ranbir. Whole industry kept quiet or supported as it had Ranbir and we know the Kapoor surname and Ranbir's behaviour and talent were the reasons. But Ranveer Singh is amazing actor and star.

reddit_nm8byh8_7909,"- Doesn't surprise me at the least about Harsh tbh. Anil generally wears his mood on his sleeve anyway, and it is so so clear that he feels disappointed and hurt with his son. Also, say what you will about their personalities, but Anil's daughters are a tight unit and really show up for family stuff, but Harsh seems to be a different case altogether. Even during Animal promos, I remember Anil saying that he drew a little bit from his own relationship with his son in terms of unsaid grudges, resentments, etc. - Y'all might kill me for saying this LOL, but Harsh is not a bad actor at all. I haven't seen Mirzya but based on Ray, Thar, and Bhavesh Joshi, he has alot of potential and he knows what he is doing. But his off-screen personality is so off-putting and he has very little screen-presence so I think the best he can do (if he gets his act together) is have a solid acting career with critical acclaim. Not star material at all. - Excited about Aryan's future after Bads. He seems hyper self-aware. He is Gen-Z, he is hella privileged, and he does not wear the shadow of legacy from his dad even though he loves to pay it tribute. He knows who he is and plays to his strengths - which is how everyone should operate in life anyway - play the cards you are dealt! Looking forward to whatever he does next. - Rohit Shetty and Kumal Khemu are actually a surprisingly great combo for a comedy that I never thought of before.

reddit_nlgz1y1,"It‚Äôs wild how folks such as yourselves u/Formal-Research1948 still throw around ""ethnic cleansing"" without looking at the raw demographics. Before you start shouting ‚Äúgenocide,‚Äù check the numbers. While nearly 851,000 Jews were living in the Arab world in 1948, that number has collapsed by over 99%, leaving: Algeria: 140,000 Jews ‚Üí today <200. That‚Äôs a 99.86% collapse. Egypt: 75,000 ‚Üí around 100. 99.87% gone. Iraq: 135,000 ‚Üí 4 left. 99.997% wiped out. Libya: 38,000 ‚Üí 0. Community erased. Morocco: 265,000 ‚Üí 2,100. Down 99.21%. Syria: 30,000 ‚Üí basically none. Tunisia: 105,000 ‚Üí 1,000. 99.05% gone. Yemen (Aden included): 63,000 ‚Üí near zero. Iran: \~100,000 ‚Üí \~8,500. 91.5% drop. Turkey: \~77,000 ‚Üí \~14,300. 81.4% decline. The Jewish life that thrived in these major urban centers back in 1948 has been utterly gutted, leaving ghost towns where vibrant communities once stood, Baghdad went from a historic Jewish metropolis down to maybe 3 people left, and the entire Egyptian Jewish community of 75,000 is now scraping by with roughly ‚àº6 in Cairo and ‚àº6 in Alexandria. Meanwhile, the communities in Tripoli, Sana‚Äôa, Gaza, Nablus, and Ramallah? They‚Äôre completely zeroed out. That‚Äôs not a ""migration""; it‚Äôs a systematic cultural annihilation. Contrast that brutality with the regions in question: Gaza‚Äôs population absolutely BALLOONED from 150,000 to over 2.2 million (a 1,379% surge), and the West Bank's numbers EXPLODED from roughly 585,500‚Äì803,600 to over 3.19 million today (a 297%‚Äì445% increase). The historical Jewish presence across MENA is a goddamn ghost story, while the Palestinian population in Judea, Samaria, and Gaza didn't shrink but instead thriving‚Äîthat's the straight-up, inconvenient reality of the numbers you're staring at. Using civilian deaths in an ongoing war as proof of ethnic cleansing while ignoring the documented expulsion and flight of nearly a million Jews from Muslim countries isn‚Äôt history, IT‚ÄôS PROPAGANDA DRESSED UP AS MORALITY. Most of the Arabs in the land migrated in from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with the development of the land under the British mandate. So saying that because for centuries Muslim empires ruled and just a few Arabs lived there, then the land now belongs to all Arabs/Muslims that come in (which is what their argument comes down to), even though they never descended from this land and they do have other ethnic states, this is the real imperialism/colonialism here. So to reconcile it for western ears they started referring themselves as ""Palestinian People"" and lie about their origin.

reddit_nlj64m9,"Wow, looks like you're the one clueless here, recycling tired propaganda without cracking a history book. Israel didn't ‚Äúcome into being by terrorising and killing innocents‚Äù, that's straight-up fiction. The UN Partition Plan in 1947 legally divided British Mandate Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, which Jews accepted but Arab leaders rejected, sparking a defensive war when five Arab armies invaded the newborn state on day one. As for ""Indians who support Israel,"" India actually voted against the partition initially due to non-aligned principles, but recognized Israel in 1950 without any ""killings""‚Äîno such historical incidents exist because pro-Israel Indians weren't targeted by founders; that's your made-up narrative to stir hate. And those spitting incidents? Yeah, isolated acts by fringe ultra-Orthodox extremists in Jerusalem, condemned by Netanyahu himself and leading to arrests by Israeli police, not some national policy. Painting all Israelis as anti-Christian (or by extension, anti-Hindu) is as dumb as saying all Muslims are terrorists; it's bigotry, not fact. Israel and India? Our bond is rock-solid on defense tech, agriculture innovation, and counter-terrorism‚Äîthink billions in trade, joint I2U2 initiatives with the US and UAE, and Modi visiting Yad Vashem‚Äînot some shadowy ""hate for Muslims"" club. We've got shared values as democracies fighting extremism, from Hamas to Lashkar-e-Taiba. As for Gaza kids‚Äîtragic as hell, no doubt, but perspective matters: Hamas launched the Oct 7 massacre, slaughtering 1,200 Israelis (mostly civilians) and taking 251 hostages, embedding rockets in schools and hospitals to use innocents as shields. Israel's targeting militants, but Hamas's strategy turns every civilian area into a battlefield, making collateral damage inevitable in urban warfare‚Äîjust like if Pakistan hit Kashmir tomorrow, we'd bomb back and call it defense, not genocide. Blaming Israel ignores Hamas's charter calling for Jewish extermination and their rejection of peace deals; the deaths are on the terrorists who started this and hide among kids. You're the one with ""lack of morality,"" excusing Hamas's child soldiers and human shields while demonizing a nation defending itself.

And yes as you said you are a 'genz' and you don't know much of him and his work but somehow you clearly know him enough to know about his tweets on Palestinian genocide. For a lot of us he was a part of our childhood and this isn't limited to just Sarabhai but multiple other shows and movies from the 90's and early 2000s. Everytime we see a person from that generation go it just feels personal. While I don't support his views on Gaza but I can still mourn for him as an actor and the part he played in probably one of the most cherished phases in my life when life was so simple and easy. Human being and emotions are complicated. And you might not always agree with someone or their ways.

reddit_nlm1jom,"I feel like both ajay and akshay married Kajol and Twinkle for their association to film families. If you know Ajay's dating history, he has only dated nepo girls (Karishma, Tabu) to be associated with big names and get their support. Whereas Kajol was actually in love with him and gushing about him all the time. The realisation that this man you love so much is merely using you and detests you must have hurt her and thats why she must be irritated with him all the time. Also explains why she is close to Jaya B. She must find her easy to confide in. For Twinkle, her career was dead/dying and it must have seemed like the only option for her to get married. Plus even tho her dad was the Rajesh Khanna he was living separately and was not financially supporting his wife. Twinkle was not duped as Kajol was and already knew about Akshay's cheating ways before marriage with Raveena, Shilpa, Rekha and 100's of other women so I'm guessing she must have made peace with it or come up with this agreement with him early on. Hence they seem much more at peace with each other. Given both Kajol and Twinkle grew up with single moms and saw the struggle of raising a child alone without the support of the husband, they might have decided to stay with their husbands because they probably wouldn't want the same for their kids. Which I would understand in the case of Twinkle because she may not have financial independence she stopped acting very early on. But I do not understand why Kajol would do this. In fact I think Kajol should humiliate Vimal Devgn and take him down publicly as she has a bigger fan following than him.

Besides, with hundreds of crew members around it's really not as intimate or romantic as it looks onscreen. Nowhere in the job description of an actor does it say you should cheat.

reddit_nm56m57_9810,Ranveer is really talented and versatile people forget and in comparison which is wrong as every actor is unique Ranbir wins even though he played the same kind of roles except Animal but due to emotional appeal and songs and great acting he is considered the best though we all will agree there is not a single movie where I felt it's Ranveer because he was always the character and with every movie of Ranbir it's always him. In India stardom is about the actor unfortunately and not character. I don't believe Ranbir has no PR. The whole industry is his PR. After Animal I was shocked to see how Shahid was treated versus Ranbir. Whole industry kept quiet or supported as it had Ranbir and we know the Kapoor surname and Ranbir's behaviour and talent were the reasons. But Ranveer Singh is amazing actor and star.

Patriarchal families need such aggression sometimes I feel having seen them in real life but they don't care and mock women to be honest. And you tell women in India to express that frustration the reaction will be raw and aggressive to be honest. Imagine the anger of being tested like that through generations. I can never explain how it feels to be in patriarchal families where women are treated like shit even if you are working you will be asked how good you are at household work. The pain of seeing your mother tested like that it is indescribable. I hate this about our culture and no remedy other than to assert ourselves and raise sons right. But no one listens to a shouting woman they call her mad if she raises her voice. Why are men not raised right and even if raised right why except for their mother every woman is a problem for them?
